DVR
================
Notes

Completed couple of the Extensions. User can see currently recording shows, or pick from a list of shows to record, as well as select a box. Was in the process of implementing Note#2 and Note#4 below. I have the code in my shows controller that would provide me with the actual show that is causing the overlap, thus allowing next steps to be implemented as listed below. 
 

What else should the DVR app be able to do:

1. If show is being recorded on one box and user selects a show to record that overlaps, it should automatically check if the other box is available
2. If show overlaps another show recording, user should have option to overwrite the recording with new show that was selected (was in process of implementing, I believe there is an issue with the respond_to do |format| block when you do format.js in Rails 4.1.0)
3. App should just show available open boxes so that user doesn’t guess/check which boxes are available
4. Selecting “record” or “cancel” on shows page should submit ajax request rather than page refresh (user may want to record multiple shows, and if there’s a long list they shouldn’t have to start again at the top) - again not sure if problem with Rails 4.1 and respond_to do |format| format.js blocks.
